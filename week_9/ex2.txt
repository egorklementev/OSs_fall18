Suppose we have 10 page frames.
Also we have page references from 1 to 20.

To increase hit/miss ratio it is obvious number of hits should be
increased or number of misses should be decreased.

Sequence 1 1 1 1 ... (n times) will give us the best hit/miss ratio
and it will be equal (n - 1) / 1 = n - 1

Sequence 1...20 (repeated n times) will give us worst hit/miss ration and it will
be equal 0 / (n * 20) = 0 
If we had 20 pages instead of 10 we would have ratio be equal 
((n * 20) - 20) / 20 = ((n - 1) * 20) / 20 = n - 1 as in the first case.
